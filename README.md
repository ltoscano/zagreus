Zagreus, son of Zeus and Persephone, was an Orphic Greek god who died by the hands of the Titans and the scheming of a jealous Hera. The heart of Zagreus was recovered and brewed into a potion. Semele consumed this potion and through it gave birth to Dionysus. Dionysus is the Greek God of the harvest, wine, and theatre. This story is told by the Greek poet Orpheus.

This project is inspired by the Orphic poem. It is through the knowledge derived from the hearts of others that we may protect our children.
